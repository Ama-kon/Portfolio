  "legal-notice-text-3": "Data Protection: The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and how we use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens. We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible. Notice of the responsible party: The responsible party for data processing on this website is: Amalia Konstantinidou, Rohrlachstrasse 93, 67063 Ludwigshafen. Phone: 01774346257. Email: Amalia_k@gmx.de. The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.). Retention period: Unless a more specific retention period is mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply. General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website: If you have given consent for data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of the GDPR. In the case of explicit consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on the GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device, data processing is additionally based on the GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for carrying out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of the GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interests. Recipients of personal data: In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so, if we have a legitimate interest in passing it on, or if another legal basis permits data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded. Withdrawal of your consent to data processing: Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent that has already been given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal. Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing: If data processing is carried out on the basis of the GDPR, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your particular situation. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If you object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms or the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of this data for such advertising purposes. This also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for the purpose of direct marketing. Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority: In the event of violations of the GDPR, the affected persons have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies. Right to data portability: You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on your consent or to fulfill a contract, in a common, machine-readable format and to have it transferred to yourself or to a third party. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible. Access, correction, and deletion: You have the right, within the scope of applicable legal provisions, to obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing, and if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for further questions on the topic of personal data, you can contact us at any time. Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases: If you dispute the accuracy of your stored personal data with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. If the processing of your personal data was unlawful or is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion. If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion. If you have lodged an objection, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may be processed - apart from storage - only with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of the European Union or a member state."
